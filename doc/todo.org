* To-do Items
** Before Next Release
*** TODO The =--top= Options Requires an Absolute Path                  :BUG:
    - Giving it a relative path will fail
*** TODO Support other generated files
    - Inkscape: SVG -> PDF
    - mscgen: MSC -> PDF
*** TODO Merge metadata when doing file inclusions
*** TODO Don't show output from =pdfcrop=
*** TODO Allow picking template sytles/files from the command line
*** TODO Paths in YAML metadata need to be converted
    - For example: =bibliography: ../metadata/citations.bib= is
      relative to the markdown file but when pandoc runs it can't find
      that file.
*** TODO Reference links in one file don't affect other files
    - Trying to put all reference links into a separate file doesn't
      work.  Pandoc marks the links as missing during file inclusion.
*** TODO Citation links don't seem to work
    - Links for a citation to the bibliography don't show up.
*** DONE Support header ID's in file inclusion syntax
    CLOSED: [2018-03-11 Sun 17:11]
    - Right now: =<<(foo.md)=
    - Also support: =<<(foo.md#someID)= to only include that header
      and content below it.
