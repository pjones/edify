* To-do Items
** Before Next Release
*** TODO The =--top= Options Requires an Absolute Path                  :BUG:
    - Giving it a relative path will fail
*** TODO Support header ID's in file inclusion syntax

    - Inkscape: SVG -> PDF
    - mscgen: MSC -> PDF
*** TODO Merge metadata when doing file inclusions
*** TODO Don't show output from =pdfcrop=
